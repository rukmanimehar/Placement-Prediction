# Placement-Prediction
This project – the "Placement Prediction " – concentrates on designing a tool that can predict a student's potential to be placed through their academic . The project employs a machine learning model . The aim is to create a user-friendly platform where students or institutions can check the probability of each student's placement .

Dataset

Separate datasets were curated from Kaggle, ensuring localized insights for enhanced prediction accuracy.

User-Friendly Interface

Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an interactive and responsive user experience.

Backend: Developed using Flask for lightweight server-side logic and secure data handling.

SQLite Database

Efficiently stores user inputs and model outputs, seamlessly integrating with the web application.

Multi-Parameter Support

Allows users to input specific attributes such as academic scores, extracurricular involvement, and skills, ensuring tailored predictions.

Data Visualization

Key insights, such as trends and factors influencing placement outcomes, are presented through interactive graphs and charts.

How It Works

Users provide student details through an intuitive form on the web application.

The application processes the data and passes it to the corresponding trained model.

The model returns the predicted placement outcome, displayed in a user-friendly format.

Visual aids help users understand the factors influencing the prediction.
